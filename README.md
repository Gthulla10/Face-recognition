# Face-recognition
Face -recognition works as finding similiar results from trained images and between test image where you will train and find if your requested image matches with test one or not. 
As it is easy to understand but still i'll explain a bit,first i started importing ,then run the directory of data(few images),afterwards next step is to give test image which i want to match from all.Moreover ,we tell where to match that test image with to find similiar patterns. last , step is to Run statements whether it is matched with test image or not.
